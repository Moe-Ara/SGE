<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Simple Game Engine (SGE) is a project built for the purpose of learning and experimenting with modern OpenGL. This engine supports basic rendering, camera control, lighting, and player movement mechanics. It serves as an excellent starting point for anyone interested in game development and computer graphics.

Here's why:
* Learn the basics of 3D rendering using OpenGL
* Implement and understand camera controls
* Experiment with basic lighting techniques
* Develop a foundational understanding of game engine architecture
